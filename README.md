**Fianchetto Chess**

I made Fianchetto Chess as my final project for the Flatiron School Software Engineering Bootcamp.
It is a chess app with a fully functional and skilled Chess AI that you can play against, as well as other modes such as 
observing the AI vs. itself, AI vs. Random Moves, and Random vs. Random.

The Chess AI was built with a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The Chess.js library was used for generation of legal moves and keeping track of the game state, and the React-Chessboard library was used to embed chessboards into the app and also to provide drag and drop move functionality.

The part of the app that I am most proud of is the AI Algorithm Visualizer, where the move tree that the computer is analyzing along with evaluations are displayed in a diagram while one plays against the computer. 

Building this app was a great experience learning how chess computers work, and it is a project that I believe could always be improved and one that I plan to continue working on.
